Super simple command line application that helped me learn my way around the basics of the C language.

User has access to 250 mls worth of coffee mug space. The user will be prompted to add espresso and milk (steamed and frothed), incrementally, to their heart's desire. After user decides to stop adding (or runs out of mug space), the program will then determine which type of espresso beverage (e.g., latte, cap, etc.) the user's concoction most closely resembles.
